Room No: 2 — Personal Fashion Advisor 

Problem Context (100 words) 
Users struggle to find clothes/accessories/beauty products aligned with their style, body type, culture, budget, and occasion. Today they depend on generic e-commerce recommendations, influencers, or manual browsing across multiple sites. This is slow, inconsistent, and often results in poor purchases, returns, and wardrobe mismatch. There’s no consultative guidance that considers constraints (budget, modesty/culture, climate, fit, availability). 

One Primary Goal 
The agent’s goal is to curate occasion-specific coordinated outfits, subject to style profile + budget + cultural preferences + occasion needs, while optimizing for coherence, confidence fit, and multi-platform availability. 

Scope and Boundaries 

Allowed: profile intake, product search/aggregation, outfit composition, styling tips, links, seasonal/weather adaptation, learn from feedback. 

Stop/ask human: before purchase, unclear budget/occasion, cultural sensitivity clarifications. 

Out of scope: auto-buy without consent, body-image assumptions, sharing profile externally. 

User Types 
End-user shopper; optionally stylist/admin for curated brand lists. 

Formal Conversation Samples 

User: “Interview outfit under ₹5k, modest.” → Agent proposes full look + alternates + links. 

User: “Swap shoes to more comfortable.” → Agent revises outfit while keeping palette + budget.
